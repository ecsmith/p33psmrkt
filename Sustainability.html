<p>How We Run A Sustainable Business:<br />
Buy local. Our products are from down the street or around the corner. Our fresh 
pastries are from Henion Bakery in Amherst. Our bagels, our foundation, are from 
Benson's Bagels in Springfield. We also have tea and beauty products that were 
home made by a People's Market alum!</p>
