We Have a Commitment to Sustainability Read our Sustainability Mission Statement Here: How We Run A Sustainable Business: Buy local. Our products are from down the street or around the corner. Our fresh pastries are from Henion Bakery in Amherst. Our bagels, our foundation, are from Benson's Bagels in Springfield. We also have tea and beauty products that were home made by a People's Market alum!
